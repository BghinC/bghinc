# Hi there 👋

I'm a **software engineer** and **web lover** born in **France** 🇫🇷. I've created several web applications using Vue (and **Nuxt** 💚), mobile applications using **Flutter** 💙. All of them relying on homemade **backends** using different frameworks.

I'm currently working from Mauritius 🇲🇺, contact me if you wanna meet!
